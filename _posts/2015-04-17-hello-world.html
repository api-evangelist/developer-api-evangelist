<p>Hello World! This is the beginning of a new portal for me, as well as a blueprint for others to follow.</p>
<p>I'm working to make sure my API developer portal is as good as I'd expect from people I review.</p>
<p>Hopefully along the way, I can establish some baselines for not just a general API portal, but also industry, and device specific.</p>
<p>As I add each building block I'll put it here, and make this into a walk through. Since this is my live site, I will fork at some point into a forkable demo.'</p>
