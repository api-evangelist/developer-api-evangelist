<p>I rate limit my APIs, only to keep a certain level of quality of service for my own apps (because I use my APIs), and for other consumers. With my APIs, its all about what I'm willing to spend on my AWS bill each month, so convince me there is a good reason you need access, and I'm will to give it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is how I break it down currently:</li>
<li>0-500 API calls per day - FREE</li>
<li>500 or more API calls per day at $0.00500 USD per call</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be working on a credit bases system at some point, and changing my model, allowing each API to be worth different amounts of credits, but for now I'll just keep a flat rate.</p>
<p>If you need more API calls, please don't sign up for multiple accounts, just let me know. Depending on what you are up to, I'm happy to allow you more API for short period, or even permanently--the key is you letting me know.</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of rate limits, but they are a reality to keep servers up, and APIs functioning as expected. Communication is more important than the rate limits, let me know where you hit the wall.</p>
