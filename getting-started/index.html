<p>This is the API platform, for accessing API Evangelist resources. As with all of my research, my APIs are a work in progress, meant primarily for my own use. However, I encourage you to play with as well, and if you require a specific level of service, please let me know, so I can help make sure and meet your needs.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to get started:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/signup" target="_blank">Register for a developer account</a></li>
	<li>Visit the <a href="/documentation/">documentation</a> for the API you wish to integrate with</li>
	<li>Import postman collections into your postman if you need to play further</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/master/issues">Submit a Github issue for this repository</a>, or each specific API if you need help</li>
</ul>

<p>I am continuing to work on the APis, and improve the design, error codes, and underlying data models. I am also working in real-time on the supporting building blocks like documentation, roadmap, etc.</p>
<p>If there is anything I can make smoother, or left out please let me know.</p>
