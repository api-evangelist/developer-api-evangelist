<p>This is the API platform, for accessing API Evangelist. As with all of my research, my APIs are a work in progress, meant primarily for my own use. However, I encourage you to play with as well, but but if you require a specific level service, please let me know, so I can help meet your objectives.</p>

<p>If you are really eager to play with it, and are willing to deal with bugs and changes while I am stabilizing, I'm happy to get you some API keys, so you can play. Just <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/developer-api-evangelist/issues">submit an issue requsting access</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="developer-api-evangelist" target="_blank">Register for a developer account</a></li>
	<li>Visit the documentation for the API you wish to integrate with</li>
	<li>Import postman collections into your postman if you need to play further</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/kinlane/developer-api-evangelist/issues">Submit a Github issue for the master repository</a>, or each specific API if you need help</li>
</ol>

<p>I am continuing to work on the APis, and improve the design, error codes, and underlying data models. I am also working in real-time on the supporting building blocks like documentation, roadmap, etc.</p>
<p>If there is anything I can make smoother, or left out please let me know.</p>
