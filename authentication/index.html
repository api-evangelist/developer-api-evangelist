<p>Since I do not store any user generated information, I do not employ oAuth, and try to keep my security as simple as possible. I use <a href="http://www.3scale.net/"></a>3Scale API infrastructure for my API management system</a>.</p>
<p>I have many public APIs that do not require a key, you can just make a request, but all the APIs that are secured, require two keys:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>appid</strong> - An unique id that is generated for each application.</li>
	<li><strong>appkey</strong> - An unique key that is generated for each application.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have chose to just include apid and appkey as a paramter, reducing friction for users, and integrations. Many API providers prefer putting them in headers, which I agree with, but I feel putting them as parameters makes them much more hackable.</p>

<p>I would keep my APIs 100% public, but I need to limit usage, because it costs me money, but also I am a firm believer in keeping an eye on who is using my APIs.</p>
