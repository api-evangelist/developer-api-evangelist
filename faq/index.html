<p>Here are some of the questions I get about my platform, and these APIs. As I get more, I will add them here, to help answer your most pressing questions, without having to contact me directly.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a name="who-is-kin-lane">Who is Kin Lane?</a> - I am the API Evangelist, an analyst and engineer who focuses exclusively on the world of APIs.</li>
	<li><a name="why-do-you-have-apis">Why do you have APIs?</a> - Everyone should have APIs, not just the Twitters of the world. I have APIs to help practice what I preach, and make my research open and accessible to everyone.</li>
	<li><a name="what-can-i-build-with-the-apis">What can I build with the APIs?</a> - That is up to you. I have APis to empower you with access to my research, what you build should benefit your world, as well as the wider API community.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Support</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a name="">What is the best way to get support?</a> - The best way is to <a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master/issues">submit a Github issue for the master API stack</a>, or via the Github repository for each API. I try to keep API specific issues local to each API, and wider conversations via the portal.</li>
	<li><a name="">Why did it take a couple days to get response?</a> - I am a one man show, and sometimes I can get to issue immediately and sometimes it takes me time. If it is mission critical, I will make time, but otherwise I queue things up.</li>
	<li><a name="">Can I email you?</a> - Sure you can, but remember that I do not always check email each day, as sometimes I tune it out to be more productive in my research. I priotize Github issues and Tweets a little differently.</li>
	<li><a name="">Can I talk to you on the phone?</a> - I take calls on Thursday, and have open office hours. Schedule something ahead of time and I'm happy to carve ou the time.</li>
</ul>
