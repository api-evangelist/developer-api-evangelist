<p>Historically I haven't been in the API business, meaning charging for my APIs. Up until now my APIs were more just playing around, and allowing access was something I did for fun.</p>
<p>Now I am slowly getting my act together and working to stand up a quality API stack, not just for my own use, but allow other 3rd parties to use acess the valuable API resources I generate.</p>
<p>As I'm working on building out my platform, and my API stack, I have three levels of pricing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retail - Free API calls up to 500 per day, then $0.005 USD per API call.</li>
<li>Partner - Custom levels of access, just let me know, and I will consider.</li>
<li>Wholesale - Deploy any of my API designs in private infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I develop my stack, and hard my API designs, and operations, I will continue to evolve how I price my APIs. Nothing is set in stone, so if you have specific needs, let me know.</p>
<p>If you are interested in any of my API designs, or have specific APIs you need designed, deployed, or managed, let me know, I have partners who are willing to assist.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience while I'm stablizing my API design, deployment, and management process, by mid summer 2015, things should be fully ready for use.</p>
