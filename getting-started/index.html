<p>This is my personal API platform, that I use to manage API Evangelist. It isn't 100% ready for everyone to use, so I'm not inviting public access to everything just yet. However since part of my goal with this API, is to help showcase some of the best practices, I am making sure it contains all of the essential building blocks that I prescribe to the rest of the space.</p>

<p>If you are really eager to play with it, and are willing to deal with bugs and changes while I am stabilizing, I'm happy to get you some API keys, so you can play. Just <a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master/issues">submit an issue requsting access</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Register for a developer account (not ready yet)</li>
	<li>Visit the documentation for the API you wish to integrate with</li>
	<li>Visit the code page, and download the language library you need</li>
	<li>Import postman collections into your postman if you need to play further</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master/issues">Submit a Github issue for the master repository</a>, or each specific API if you need help</li>
</ol>

<p>I am continuing to work on the APis, and improve the design, error codes, and underlying data models. I am also working in real-time on the supporting building blocks like documentation, roadmap, etc.</p>
<p>If there is anything I can make smoother, or left out please let me know.</p>
